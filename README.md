# DS320Project
This is our DS 320 project.

We are doing kaggle playground competitions for PUBG Finish Placement Prediction. Using multiple algorithms(Catboost,xgboost and Lightgbm) to do the training and finally use ensemble to create a better predict performance.

Also this competition is kernel only.
