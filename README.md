# PSU DS320 Final Project
### Goal:
Practice and use what we learn about data fusion, apply with machine learning.

### Approach:
We are doing kaggle playground competitions for PUBG Finish Placement Prediction. Using multiple algorithms(Catboost,xgboost and Lightgbm) to do the training and finally use ensemble to create a better predict performance. Also this competition is kernel only.
